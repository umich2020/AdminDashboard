# AdminDashboard
TOP capstone project, admin dashboard

While this is a capstone project, this is also primiarly a front end focused project.
It's not required to make it responsive, so I wont. I will primarily be using grid.
And I'll choose a reasonable coloring. The specs for the project are at:

Steps I'm going to do:
1. Create base html and link css. DONE
2. Write out html elements.  DONE
3. Write out grid properties to create layout DONE
4. Organize header DONE
5. Organize side bar
6. Organize main content
7. get icons and external font-doing it after html maybe? or we can wait after getting the decen layout
